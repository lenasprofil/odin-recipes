      Sushi Bake is a trendy Japanese-inspired dish that consists of sushi rice, imitation crab meat, and various toppings, baked in a casserole dish until golden and bubbly. 
      It's often served as a fun and easy way to enjoy the flavors of sushi in a more casual setting.

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 200Â°C.</li>
        <li>Season the salmon fillet with pepper, salt, garlic powder and paprika powder. Fry it in a pan over medium heat for about 10 minutes, or until it's cooked through.</li>

        <li>Add the rice vinegar to the cooked sushi rice and stir well. Spread the rice in an oven-safe dish, creating a flat surface with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle shredded nori seaweed over the top of the rice, using two sheets in total.</li>
        <li>Add the salmon and surimi mixture to the dish, spreading it out evenly over the rice.</li>
